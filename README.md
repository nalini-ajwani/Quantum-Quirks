# Quantum-Quirks
This repository is a collection of my explorations into the world of quantum computing using the python library qiskit. As I delve into the concepts and principles of quantum computing, this repository is divided into three parts to help structure my learning journey.

# Repository Structure
Part 1: Quantum Computer Programming
A practical and applied introduction to quantum computer programming, using IBM's free cloud-based quantum machines and Qiskit.

Part 2: Qubits and Gates
Diving deeper into Qubits, what they really are, how to visually represent a qubit, and how quantum gates impact these qubits.

Part 3: Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm
Exploring our first quantum algorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
